          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>With over a decade of development experience in the stock market I realized that the typical thing is to invest 
            in the right stock. All investers rarely analise how stocks work about.It includes various factors might be the
            news,government,growth or crisis in the market,business,etc.It would be better if you take guidance in your investment.
          </p>

          <p>The main theme of the website is to make people aware of the stock market and its benifits in today's society by 
            helping them to predict the values of the stock for the next day.It basically depends on the stock values from the past 
            few years stock values.
            It tells about the various stock values running at that current point of time by redirecting to trustable 
            websites.You can also view the trending news in the current stock market redirecting to the news websitess based on the
            stocks and its growth and fall in the value.
          </p>

          <p>The underlining thought of the website i.e, to predict the stock values  is still under process.
